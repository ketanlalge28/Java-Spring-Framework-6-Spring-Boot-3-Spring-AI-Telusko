## MVC (Model View Controller)
- MVC is a design pattern commonly used in software development

  ### 1. Model (Simple classes or pojo classes)
  - Represents the data and the business logic of the application.
  - It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.

### 2. View (JSP)
- Responsible for the UI (User Interface).
- It displays data to the user and sends user actions (like button clicks) to the controller
- These are generally HTML page, JSP, or a GUI screen

### 3. Controller (Servlet)
- Acts as a bridge between Model and View.
- It receives user input from the View, processes it (using Model), and then updates the View.

## Spring Security


### What is CSRF?
- In Spring Security, CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection is enabled by default to prevent malicious websites from making unwanted requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- CSRF is an attack where a logged-in userâ€™s credentials are used (without their knowledge) to perform unwanted actions (like submitting a form, deleting a resource, etc.) on a web application.

## Spring Aop
- Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a powerful feature of the Spring Framework that allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, transactions, performance monitoring, etc.) from the main business logic of your application.

 ### When to Use Spring AOP?
- Logging
- Security checks (authentication/authorization)
- Transaction management
- Performance monitoring (execution time)
- Exception handling
